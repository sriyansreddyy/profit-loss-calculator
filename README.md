# Profit and Loss Calculator using Java
A Simple Profit-Loss Calculator created using Java
It calculates the values according to what the user gives. Copy paste this code into your Java IDE(I've used IntelliJ Idea) and give it some value. It shows the value in INR.
# Features
- Accepts values, only numerals though (because we're calculating money over here)
